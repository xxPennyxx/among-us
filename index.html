                <p>The main objective of the <strong>Crewmates</strong> is to finish the tasks assigned to them. If all the crewmates finish their tasks, they win the game. They must also fix sabotaged equipment such as Comms, lights, and O2 in order to survive.</p>

                <p>The <strong>Impostors</strong> are the 'bad guys' of the game, who have to mingle with the crew while secretly sabotaging ship equipment and killing crewmates. Impostors can pass through vents to make their job easier. Since November 2021, impostors can also disguise themselves to other crewmates to confuse players. In July 2024, impostors gained the ability to take on the role of Phantoms, allowing them to vanish for short periods, making the game even harder.</p>

                <p>At the start of the game, players are randomly assigned the role of Crewmate or Impostor. Players must keep their role secret, except during meetings or reports. If you think someone is the Impostor, you can call an Emergency Meeting or report a dead body to discuss. The voting process follows, and the person with the most votes gets ejected. The game reveals whether or not they were an Impostor.</p>

                <h3>How Hide-and-Seek Works</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>In the Hide-and-Seek mode, the Impostor (the Seeker) is revealed to everyone. The Crewmates get 10 seconds to hide. After that, the Seeker has a limited amount of time to find and kill all the Crewmates. The Seeker starts with low vision, but during the final buffer time, they gain a speed boost and can track the Crewmates every 5 seconds. Crewmates must finish tasks to survive, and if they die, they can help track others still in the game.</p>
                <p>If at least two Crewmates survive, they win the game!</p>
