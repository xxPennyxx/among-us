# Among Us
## Welcome to the beginner's guide to Among Us!!

Among Us is a multiplayer game of survival and betrayal, developed by Innersloth in 2018. It features up to 15 players in a lobby, who are either **crewmates** or **impostors**.

### Crewmates
The main objective of the **Crewmates** is to finish the tasks assigned to them. If all the crewmates finish their tasks then they win the game. They must also fix sabotaged equipment such as Comms, lights and O2 in order to survive in the game.

### Impostors
The **Impostors** are the 'bad guys' of the game, who have to mingle with the crew while secretly sabotaging ship equipment and killing everyone in the crew. The Impostors can pass through vents to make their job easier. Since November 2021, it has also been possible for impostors to disguise themselves to other crewmates and confuse players. Since July 2024, impostors can even take on the role of Phantoms to vanish and hence make the game even harder.

### Roles
The crewmates can be assigned the **Scientist** or **Engineer** role, depending on how many of those crewmates can have the role. Those settings can be changed, of course, before the game starts.
The **Scientist** can access vitals of other players from anywhere. They must complete tasks to recharge their battery.
The **Engineer** can use the vents, however, they have a cooldown and can only stay inside the vent for a limited time, unlike Impostors.
The Impostor can be a **Shapeshifter**, that is, they can morph into their impostor teammates or other crewmates. They do have a time limit for being in the form of the other crewmate, though.
Dead crewmates can be **Guardian Angels**. They can protect other crewmates from being killed during gameplay.
In July 2024, three new roles were introduced to the game, namely, the **Tracker** (for crewmates), the **Noisemaker** (for crewmates), and the **Phantom** (for impostors).
The **Tracker** can track the presence of a crewmate in the map. If the tracking freezes, that means the crewmate has been killed.
The **Noisemaker** emits a noise after they have been killed. Players may follow the noise to see where they were killed and spot for any clues.
The **Phantom** can vanish for a limited amount of time. They cannot kill crewmates during this time. They can, however, be tracked by the Tracker.

### Gameplay
At the start of the game, the game decides whether you are a Crewmate or an Impostor. The players must NOT reveal their role to others. They must keep mum throughout the game, except during meetings or reports. There are upto 3 Impostors in a game of 10. 
Anyone can call an Emergency Meeting when they feel they know who the Impostor is. There is a limited number of meetings available to each crewmate-- and they cannot be called when any equipment has been sabotaged.
If a crewmate sees a dead body, he can report it.
If a meeting is called or a dead body is reported, the crewmates can now discuss among themselves and find out who the Impostor is. The Impostors here can lie to distract the other crewmates. Then the voting process begins. The crewmate who has the maximum votes gets ejected, and the game reveals whether or not he was an Impostor.

### Maps
Among Us has 5 maps: The Skeld, Mira HQ, Polus, the Airship, and the Fungle, which released in October 2023. Each of the maps has distinct locations with task sites and vents. A crewmate can view CCTV footage or player position via Security and Admin systems respectively.

### Colours
Each crewmate has a unique colour they can pick: black, blue, brown, cyan, green, lime, orange, pink, purple, red, white and yellow. Six new colours have been introduced in the June 2021 update: banana, coral, gray, maroon, rose and tan.

### Tips and Tricks for Impostors
- A self-report is when you kill a crewmate and immediately report it. This is NOT A GOOD IDEA!!!
- Time your kill well. Make sure no one is around, and ALWAYS check your kill cooldown. Never kill near a corridor.
- DO NOT fake visual tasks such as MedBay scan, asteroids and trash. The other crewmates can see you're faking them!
- Do not try the fake AFK trick anywhere!
- Make sure you do not kill or vent where the cameras can see you!
- Keep an eye on the shift and vent cooldown meters.

### Hide-and-Seek mode
In December 2022, a new mode was introduced called the **Hide-and-Seek** mode. At the start of the game, the Impostor, also called the **Seeker**, is revealed to the entire lobby. The crewmates have 10 seconds to hide until the Seeker is ready to pounce.
The Seeker has a limited amount of time to kill all crewmates in the lobby, following which they win. Initially, they start with low vision, but during the final buffer time, they gain a speed boost and an ability to track the crewmates every 5 seconds. They cannot use the vents.
Crewmates must finish tasks in order to decrease the time left to survive. They may use the vents to hide, for a limited amount of time. Once they die, they may "enjoy the chaos" and choose to track another player still in the game.
If the crewmates survive the initial round after the time is up, they enter the buffer round aka **Seek Mode**. The game gets even harder for them as the Seeker gains additional abilities.
If at least two crewmates survive the game, they win!
